Help on supersh:

DESCRIPTION
    supersh is shell app which can evaluate mathematical
    expresions, store data in variables, save values of variables
    into a file and more...


COMMANDS
    #exit
        Quit (this means do not show another supersh prompt)

    #help
        Show this help (in standard output).
    
    #var <name> = <value> // can be shortened to $<name> = <value>
        Assigns <value> to a variable <name>.
        <value> can be of type int, float or str (or it can be
        an expression - see below)
        Naming convention:
            <name> should start with an alphabet letter or underscore (_)
            and it should contain only A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore (_).
    
    #save <filename>
        Saves current values of variables to file with name <filename>.
        This values can be restored even after killing app or rebooting
        computer.
        If no <filename> is provided, values are saved to vars.txt
    
    #load <filename>
        Loads variable values from file with name <filename>.
        If no <filename> is provided, values are loaded from vars.txt
        NOTE: Current variables could be overridden by those in this file.


EXPRESSIONS
    Numeric mathematical expresions (examples)
        4 * 3 -> 12
        (14 - 1) // 2 -> 6
        (12 % 10) / 3 -> 0.6666666666666666
    
    String operations (examples)
        "super" + "sh" -> "supersh"
        "super" + "sh" * 5 -> "supershshshshsh"
    
    Mathematical expresions with variables (examples)
        // assuming a == 4 and b == 2.5
        a * 3 -> 12
        (7 % a) // 2 -> 1
        3 * (b / 5) -> 1.5
